# Project Description
Domain: Linguistics Field Research and Language Data Management.

The project is a fieldwork tool for linguistics researchers, it allows them to view and update language information with an interface and keep track of the speakers of said languages. Our project allows for the following functionality:
- View Languages and the language families
- View total speakers across all dialects to view popularity of language
- Show languages that have ancient writing systems (which may have historical data)
- Add, update, and remove languages
- Search for languages by the age of the writing system, the status and the name of the language to facilitate finding information
- View phonetic data by selecting which distinctive features of phonemes to view to use as reference when making transcriptions
- View speakers of a language and which dialect they speak to determine who to study for research
- View the country with the highest number of speakers on file to determine where to conduct research
- View words in a language that are shared across all dialects for linguistic comparison
