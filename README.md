- View phonetic data by selecting which distinctive features of phonemes to view to use as reference when making transcriptions
- View speakers of a language and which dialect they speak to determine who to study for research
- View the country with the highest number of speakers on file to determine where to conduct research
- View words in a language that are shared across all dialects for linguistic comparison
