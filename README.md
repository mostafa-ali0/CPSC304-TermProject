# Project Description
Domain: Linguistics Field Research and Language Data Management.


The database can be used as a tool for linguistic researchers to record data collected in the field when encountering new words, phonemes, and dialects of various languages. Researchers will also be able to record information upon meeting speakers of different languages, including their country of origin and any other relevant personal information. Outside of the field, linguistics professionals can refer back to this database for data on languages and phonetics.
